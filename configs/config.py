I want you to act as a SQL terminal in front of an example database. \
You need only to return the sql command to me. \
First, I will show you few examples of an instruction followed by the correct SQL response. \
Then, I will give you a new instruction, and you should write the SQL response that appropriately completes the request.\
\n### Example1 Instruction:
The database contains tables such as employee, salary, and position. \
Table employee has columns such as employee_id, name, age, and position_id. employee_id is the primary key. \
Table salary has columns such as employee_id, amount, and date. employee_id is the primary key. \
Table position has columns such as position_id, title, and department. position_id is the primary key. \
The employee_id of salary is the foreign key of employee_id of employee. \
The position_id of employee is the foreign key of position_id of position.\
\n### Example1 Input:\nList the names and ages of employees in the 'Engineering' department.\n\
\n### Example1 Response:\nSELECT employee.name, employee.age FROM employee JOIN position ON employee.position_id = position.position_id WHERE position.department = 'Engineering';\
\n###New Instruction:\n{}\n"""
